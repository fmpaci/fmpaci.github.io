    ## **How to Evaluate Your Graph Neural Network Explanation by Retraining**
    
    ---
    Currently, several metrics have been proposed to evaluate the faithfulness of current state-of-the-art explanation methods
    in graph neural networks. However, there are several drawbacks among these evaluation metrics 
    that make their fair comparison challenging. Through this project, we mentioned these drawbacks 
    and instead proposed novel solutions with a guideline assisting in analyzing the focus of these 
    explainers better, and the target Graph Neural Networks.

    ## **LAP:An Attention-Based Module for Faithful Interpretation and Knowledge Injection in Convolutional Neural Networks**
    
    ---
    Through this project, we devised a self-interpretable model which could be easily injected into any CNN network.
    The method is a novel inspiration of both pooling and attention-based methods representing promising results 
    on many experiments passing state-of-the-art methods.

    ## **An Artificial Intelligence-Based Computer Aided Detection Tool Helping Radiologists in Reading Digital Mammograms. (Medical publication)**
    
    ---
    Breast cancer is considered the deadliest one among women. Our main goal is to provide 
    an AI assistant product to help radiologists with more accurate and swifter decision-making 
    through mammography screening and therefore increase the survival rate of our Iranian mothers 
    and ladies. As a member of the scientific team, I have contributed to a huge project 
    containing multiple sub-branches, including pre and post-image processing, malignancy classification, and lesion segmentation,
    using mostly weakly and semi-supervised methods due to insufficient annotated data.
