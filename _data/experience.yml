  job_title: R&D Scientist
  dates: April 2021 - December 2022
  description: |
    For more than a year and a half, I have been collaborating with the CommaMed start-up, 
    which our goal is to both accelerate and increase the accuracy of diagnosis 
    by devising novel AI methods. During this duration:
    * We have been developing multiple semi/weak supervision methods to fill the absence
    of sufficient data, and our framework is capable of diagnosing malignancy and localizing 
    highly risk abnormalities with low miss rates. 
    * In addition, I have contributed to the mentorship and management of interns, guiding
    them through a sub-branch of projects including devising and implementing more semi-supervised 
    methods with higher accuracy.
    * For some reasons, including making run-time faster, I have also transported our python codes to C++, using Libtorch.
