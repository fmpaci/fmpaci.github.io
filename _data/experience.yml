    I was working on developing semi-supervised methods to recognize the type of gait disorders of patients using video-series skeleton data. 
    The main challenge here was the data itself. 
    Due to the high number of unlabeled data and a considerable amount of missing points of multiple video-series samples, we tried to develop a semi-supervised method to leverage most of these samples.

    Through those seven months, I have been working under the co-supervision of Prof. 
    Navab and Prof. Rueckert, where our main focus is to analyze the drawbacks of current 
    evaluation metrics for explanation methods in graph neural networks, and instead 
    devise a new evaluation metric to better represent the faithfulness of these explainers.

  job_title: R&D Scientist
  dates: April 2021 - December 2022
  description: |
    For more than a year and a half, I have been collaborating with the CommaMed start-up, 
    which our goal is to both accelerate and increase the accuracy of diagnosis 
    by devising novel AI methods. During this duration:
    * We have been developing multiple semi/weak supervision methods to fill the absence
    of sufficient data, and our framework is capable of diagnosing malignancy and localizing 
    highly risk abnormalities with low miss rates. 
    * In addition, I have contributed to the mentorship and management of interns, guiding
    them through a sub-branch of projects including devising and implementing more semi-supervised 
    methods with higher accuracy.
    * For some reasons, including making run-time faster, I have also transported our python codes to C++, using Libtorch.

    In August, I joined [**DML lab**](http://dml.ce.sharif.edu/dmlsite/) as a **Research assistant** where I was working
    on the impact of **contrastive learning** approaches on **deep reinforcement-learning** algorithms.
    to be more specific, I implemented [**CURL**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04136.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com) 
    and [**SIMCLR**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf) (via Pytorch) algorithms to improve the movement of an agent
    within the Maze environment.
